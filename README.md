# Web-Scraping
my collection of projects where I work with web scraping

firstScrapeLebron.py --> first attempt using Beautiful soup, take lebrons stats from Basketball reference and put it into a pandas DF

compareMLBplayers may 26 2022 --> first result of comparing mlb players, everything run through the console
Notes:
- can only compare batters, not pitchers
- only has WAR, hits, at bats, hrs, average
- some players this does work (Giancarlo Stanton, name used to be mike, so url is messed up)
- ^ some players have name so URL is messed up
- player name input should be two words (fname, lname) separated by a space
What I want to add:
- pitchers stats
- if error occurs, fix it in run time, so function still runs without errors
- add visualization for stats
- add interativeness for inputting places (not through console)
